<h2>What I’m doing now</h2>

<p class="updated">
Updated on January 12th, 2026, from my apartment in Burleigh Heads, Australia.
</p>

<h3>Running my Lead Generation Agency</h3>

<p>
I’ve been running Remo Acquisition for over 10 months. We started re-launching our clients on
January 7th after a three-week break due to market conditions.
</p>

<p>
I’m still handling ad creation, testing, media buying, and tracking, while my business partner
focuses on sales.
</p>

<p>
We’ve stopped charging clients per lead after delivery and are now charging weekly lead
packages upfront.
</p>

<p>
For example: a client pays $420 upfront for 3 leads. We use that cash to run ads and deliver the
leads. What we don’t spend is profit.
</p>

<p>
This feels more sustainable and predictable, and clients like it better. My main focus now is
keeping lead quality high while increasing margins. We’re below 40% this month so far, and I
want it above 50%.
</p>

<h3>Philosophy, Purpose, and Direction</h3>

<p>
The monotony of my business, how busy summer is on the Gold Coast, the disproportionately high
rent I’m committed to for three more months, and spending time with my family in Italy for
Christmas forced me to stop and reconsider the direction of my life.
</p>

<p>
I want to move toward a simpler life. More frugality. Fewer new desires. Adapting my ambitions to
my current reality.
</p>

<p>
I don’t want just money anymore. I want tranquility and purpose.
</p>

<p>
I circled back to Stoicism after four years, and I’m finally in a position to appreciate and apply
those principles properly.
</p>

<h3>New Year’s Resolutions</h3>

<p>
I don’t believe in New Year’s resolutions, but I accidentally made a few meaningful changes
around that time.
</p>

<p>
After reading <em>Anything You Want</em> by Derek Sivers, I realized that I don’t want a luxurious
life, a fast car, a big house, or a massive business.
</p>

<p>
After removing monetary and status-driven goals, I landed on a new vision:
</p>

<p>
Buying land in the countryside with my best friends and building my own house where I’ll live
with my wife and kids.
</p>

<p>
Within a week, this goal changed my actions: I spent over 20 hours studying carpentry, reached
out to more than 15 construction companies on the Gold Coast, and started conversations with two
that are open to giving me a shot as a labourer or apprentice.
</p>

<p>
And I’m genuinely excited.
</p>

<h3>Job vs Art</h3>

<p>
One idea that stuck with me is separating income from art.
</p>

<p>
Instead of turning carpentry into a financial dependency, I want my business to cover my living
expenses while carpentry remains creative, meaningful, and curiosity-driven.
</p>

<p>
So that’s the plan: keep the business stable, and keep carpentry fun.
</p>
